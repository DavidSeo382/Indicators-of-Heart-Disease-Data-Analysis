# Key Indicators of Heart Disease Data Analysis

## Overview
Conducted data analysis on dataset from Kaggle which displays some key indicators of heart disease. Utilized statistical analysis such as a permutation test to see if a column was correlated with heart disease. Also created pivot tables to understand the likelihood of someone contracting heart disease if they experienced certain conditions. Created many different visualizations such as horizontal bar charts and scatter plots to display analysis. Afterwards, I created a presentation to discuss my findings and to provide possible heart disease prevention tactics.
